#### 1.3 Map Behaviours to Agile Manifesto

**Type**: Excersize

**Typical Elapse Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**

Allows students to visualise that the characteristics that make amazing teams are tightly linked to the items on the left of the agile manifesto, and rarely have anything to-do with the things on the right.

**Steps**

- *Facilitator: Copy down the cards collected from the Great Teams excersize, resize them all to the same size and then group them in a grid*
- 

**Take Away**

- What are the shared attributes of a successfully team.

**Discussion**

- Items that went to the right! Are they really part of great teams or are folks gaming the system?
- 

**Virtual Delivery**

This is best facilitated in Mural/ Miro with the tickets from the [1.1 Characteristics](1.1-Characteristics.md) excersize.
